# About Me

Hello! I am IchHabeHunger54, or IHH54 for short. I am currently 19 years old and live in Austria.

I'm currently studying computer science at the Technical University of Vienna. I also make Minecraft mods, as well as trying other fields, such as music production and video editing. My main language is Java, I know a few other languages such as Python, C#, JavaScript or Haskell as well.

I am a proud member of the [NeoForged](https://github.com/neoforged) project as a moderator, and I have contributed to its [documentation](https://github.com/neoforged/Documentation) in the past.

Also, I am the co-leader of [Minecraftschurli Mods](https://github.com/MinecraftschurliMods), an organization led by my good friend [Minecraftschurli](https://github.com/Minecraftschurli). Under this organization, we create mods such as [Ars Magica: Legacy](https://github.com/MinecraftschurliMods/Ars-Magica-Legacy), [Potion Bundles](https://github.com/MinecraftschurliMods/PotionBundles) or the WIP [Bibliocraft Legacy](https://github.com/MinecraftschurliMods/Bibliocraft-Legacy).

If you want to contact me, you can best do so on the [NeoForged Discord server](https://discord.neoforged.net/), or on [my own Discord server](https://discord.gg/GM6XSqM).

Have a nice day!
